# Mood-tracker-app
This is a web application I created when I was just getting started with NodeJS. 

We all have faced this problem where we cannot remember what our mood was on a particular day at a particular place. 
This app lets you save your mood along with the current location and time data.

Be sure to add environment variables in a .env file as suggested in .env_sample file.
To run the application, run the following command:

npm start

Have fun!
