Hi, this is a web application I created when I was just getting started with Javascript and Nodejs.

My aim in creating this app is to build an end to end service with minimum third party dependencies. 
The fronted has been built from scratch without any framework. 
The backend uses Express.js (for now). Will try to remove this dependency also in future.

Be sure to add environment variables in a .env file as suggested in .env_sample file.
To run the application, run the following command:

npm start


For any suggestions, reach out to soru.mehta@gmail.com
Have fun!
